## ✨ Project Highlights: *Image Sharpening Using Knowledge Distillation*

### 🏁 **Outcomes: What We Achieved**
- 🧠 Built a powerful **teacher-student model** duo using **Knowledge Distillation** to sharpen blurry images in **real time**.
- 📸 Achieved **crisp, clear output** with **SSIM scores > 0.90**, even under limited bandwidth and low-end hardware conditions.
- ⚡️ Student model runs at **30–60 FPS**, delivering **high performance + low compute cost** — perfect for **video conferencing** and **live enhancement tasks**.
- 💡 Balanced **speed and accuracy**, preserving most of the teacher model's capability in a compact form.

### ⚠️ **Limitations: Every Hero Has a Weakness**
- 🧪 **Slight loss in ultra-fine detail** when compared to the teacher model — a trade-off for speed.
- 🖥️ **High training time & resource usage** for the teacher model due to its deep CNN architecture.
- 📊 **Limited dataset** (377 images) — results are promising but could improve with larger and more varied data.

### 🚀 **Future Scope: Where We’re Headed**
- 🌐 Train on **diverse, real-world degradations** for better generalization.
- 🧠 Add **attention layers or multi-scale learning** to boost sharpness in fine details.
- 🎯 Switch to **perceptual losses (VGG, MS-SSIM)** for human-like visual improvement.
- 📱 Deploy on **edge devices** using **TensorFlow Lite** or **ONNX** — think mobile, webcam filters, IoT!
